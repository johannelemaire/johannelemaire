## Hi! I'm Johanne (she/her)ðŸ‘‹


I have 10+ years of analytics experience, a Master of Science in Economics, Engineering, and Management and a background in market analysis and product marketing. 

Have a look at my work [portfolio](https://public.tableau.com/profile/johanne.lemaire#!/), my [website](http://johannelemaire.com/), and my [LinkedIn career page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannelemaire?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3B45IcmoU4T4aRLVI42AAb3g%3D%3D) or reach out directly to [johanne.lemaire@gmail.com](mailto:johanne.lemaire@gmail.com) so we can discuss how I can help you. 

 <!--I am passionate about using data to effect change: defining Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), in-depth analysis, and communicating insight through data visualization.

What I do best is linking cross-functional teams by speaking to everyone in their own language. Most importantly, I work with teams to identify opportunities for improving customer outcomes based on actionable recommendations.!-->
